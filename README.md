# Run-Jump-Shuffle

This project was created at HackWSU 2017 with a team of 4 members. It was the introduction to unity
and game development for our team members, as well as our first time trying to work on a multiplayer
game that uses a server.

This game is incomplete and is only a game prototype that we were able to create during the 36 hour
long hackthon.
